## What is This Thing?

Rick's Code Analyzer is a Python-based static code analysis tool for detecting code smells, security vulnerabilities, and poor programming practices in your codebase. The tool provides detailed reports with visualizations, metrics, and recommendations, all wrapped in a delightfully sarcastic Rick and Morty themed interface.

Designed to assess code quality in various languages with a heavy dose of sass, because let's face it, your code could probably use some tough love.

## Installation

Even Jerry could follow these steps (probably):

```bash
# Clone the repository 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ricks-code-analyzer.git
cd ricks-code-analyzer

# Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Required packages:
  - `jinja2`: For HTML report generation
  - `pygments`: For code syntax highlighting
  - `chardet`: For file encoding detection

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Run the analyzer
python rickscode_advanced.py

# Or for command-line usage (if implemented)
python rickscode_advanced.py --path /path/to/your/terrible/code
```

1. Select your project directory
2. Run basic analysis
3. Run advanced analysis
4. Generate an HTML report
5. Marvel at how many issues Rick found in your code

## Contributions

Pull requests are acceptable, but Rick will judge them harshly. As he would say:

> "If you somehow make this tool better, consider it beginner's luck. If you break it, well... that's just classic Jerry."

## License

This project is licensed under the "Don't Be a Jerry" License - Basically, do whatever you want but don't blame me when you break it.
